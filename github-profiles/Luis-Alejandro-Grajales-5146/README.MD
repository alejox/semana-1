### 👨‍💻 **PERSONAL**

Graphic designer and
music graduate with
professional experience
in work environments,
passionate about
programming.

I am an enterprising and
innovative person; I
consider myself selftaught
since I have
promoted projects
without any prior
knowledge, I demand
myself in order to
acquire the necessary
tools to use and carry
out the proposed work.
